USED ECOSYSTEM
```bash
# NUXTJS 3 and VUETIFY
Im using OPTIONS API.
* Easier to read and write for developers coming from Vue 2.
* Organizes code by option blocks (data, methods, computed, mounted, etc.), making it easier to follow for many developers.

Overall 
Im using OPTIONS API because it's simple, readable, aligns with Vuetify patterns, and avoids unnecessary complexity of the project scope.
```
